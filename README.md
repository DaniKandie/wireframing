# 📐 Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is the first step in designing a website or app. It’s like drawing a blueprint for your design — just like an architect does for a house.

Wireframes are simple sketches that show how different parts of a page will be arranged. They help designers and developers understand what the user will see and how they will use the product.

### 🧠 Why is Wireframing Important?

- It helps plan the layout before writing any code
- Saves time by identifying problems early
- Makes it easier for teams to talk about the design
- Helps test ideas quickly before building the final product
