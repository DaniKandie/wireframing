# Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is the first step in designing a website or app. It’s like drawing a blueprint for your design — just like an architect does for a house.

Wireframes are simple sketches that show how different parts of a page will be arranged. They help designers and developers understand what the user will see and how they will use the product.

###  Why is Wireframing Important?

- It helps plan the layout before writing any code
- Saves time by identifying problems early
- Makes it easier for teams to talk about the design
- Helps test ideas quickly before building the final product

## Key Elements of a Wireframe

A good wireframe has the following important parts:

### 1. Layout Structure
This is how items are arranged on the screen — like the header at the top, menu on the left, and content in the center.

*Example:* The logo and navigation menu are at the top of the screen.

### 2. Navigation
This includes menus, buttons, or links that help users move from one page to another.

*Example:* A side menu with links to Home, Profile, and Settings.

### 3. Content Placement
Where text, images, and other elements are placed on the page.

*Example:* A product title at the top with the price and image below it.

### 4.  Functionality
Basic interactions that should be available in the layout — like buttons, forms, and input fields.

*Example:* A "Search" bar that lets users type and look for something.

## Types of Wireframes

Wireframes can be simple or very detailed. These are the two types:

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
These are simple black-and-white sketches with boxes and lines.

- Quick to create
- Focus only on structure and layout
- No colors or images

*Used in the early design stage to plan the basic look.*

###  High-Fidelity Wireframes
These are more detailed designs. They look like real screens.

- Include fonts, colors, icons, and real text
- Show exactly what the final product will look like
- Can be turned into a prototype

*Used in later stages to show exactly how everything will work.*

## Example Wireframe Analysis

I reviewed the wireframe from the ALX platform [here](https://savanna.alxafrica.com/rltoken/HnTbrzrJX1IfPIxugo8Uvw).

### What Type of Wireframe is It?

Based on the details, this wireframe is a:

**High-Fidelity Wireframe**

### Reason:

It includes detailed elements such as colors, images, icons, and styled text. This makes it visually close to the final product. High-fidelity wireframes are typically used in the **later stages** of design to present how the product will look and feel before development starts.
