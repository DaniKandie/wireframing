# Introduction to Wireframing

Wireframing is the first step in designing a website or app. It’s like drawing a blueprint for your design — just like an architect does for a house.

Wireframes are simple sketches that show how different parts of a page will be arranged. They help designers and developers understand what the user will see and how they will use the product.

###  Why is Wireframing Important?

- It helps plan the layout before writing any code
- Saves time by identifying problems early
- Makes it easier for teams to talk about the design
- Helps test ideas quickly before building the final product

## Key Elements of a Wireframe

A good wireframe has the following important parts:

### 1. Layout Structure
This is how items are arranged on the screen — like the header at the top, menu on the left, and content in the center.

*Example:* The logo and navigation menu are at the top of the screen.

### 2. Navigation
This includes menus, buttons, or links that help users move from one page to another.

*Example:* A side menu with links to Home, Profile, and Settings.

### 3. Content Placement
Where text, images, and other elements are placed on the page.

*Example:* A product title at the top with the price and image below it.

### 4.  Functionality
Basic interactions that should be available in the layout — like buttons, forms, and input fields.

*Example:* A "Search" bar that lets users type and look for something.
